    question: 'Is Outliers an internship?',
    answer:
      'No, Outliers is not an internship or a replacement for an internship. If you have a full-time summer internship, you still qualify to participate in this program.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to be technical to apply?',
    answer:
      'Yes, but we do not care where you got your technical knowledge from. In fact, weâ€™ve found the best builders are the ones who are constantly teaching themselves and working on projects outside of classes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to know how to code in Solidity, RUST, etc.?',
    answer:
      'Teaching you how to code on-chain will not be included in Outliers programming, so we expect that your coding/learning ability will be sufficient to allow you to participate in our building projects. To support you along the way, we will provide relevant resources and technical mentorship.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to be working on a startup to apply to Outliers?',
    answer:
      'No! Outliers is not an accelerator/incubator. While many of our members are hacking away on side projects, we are selecting builders based on their technical skills and aptitude for leadership. Outliers is not intended to be a replacement for an accelerator program.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does Outliers provide funding?',
    answer:

    question: 'How long is the Outliers program?',
    answer:
      'The short answer is 10 weeks. The long answer is forever! We expect Outliers to remain in touch with each other long after the official program is over, and we also expect them to give back to the community. Future classes will be expected to continue to engage and strengthen the community even after the official program ends.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the 2022 program dates?',

    question: 'Will Outliers teach me how to be a VC?',
