There‚Äôs a tension present in web3 go to markets‚Äìit‚Äôs easier to get early adopters/people excited about the tech, but every ‚Äúproven‚Äù go to market (tokens, pfp drop, etc.) have misaligned incentives. The best way to figure this out is to do the opposite‚Äìget as many promising shots on goal as possible.',

      'For a typical NFT project, once art is generated from traits and minted as an NFT, not much happens with the NFT‚Äôs art. Nordle is different, it‚Äôs interactive with a rewarding mechanism for larger collections.\n\nNewly minted NFTs contain simple phrases like "unicorn", "this", or "happy". These phrases are then used as prompts to OpenAI\'s DALL-E to generate the corresponding image. Once the user acquires two or more Nordle NFTs, she can combine the NFTs to produce a new Nordle NFT! If the user owns a ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù NFT and a ‚Äúhappy‚Äù NFT, she can call our contract to combine the words in the desired sequence, generating a new random image with the newly combined words. Now the user gets the ‚Äúhappy unicorn‚Äù NFT (or ‚Äúunicorn happy‚Äù) and burns the old NFTs (the record is still maintained). This process can be repeated infinitely to fully reap the benefit of DALL-E while rewarding the collection of cool and/or transitory words!',

      "A core aspect of any community is the bonds between each of the members. Typically, this happens organically when groups meet up in person for a scheduled meeting, relaxing lunch, or a spontaneous hike. However, this is a luxury for the communities that exist online. In fact, for communities like the Outliers where members span across multiple states and even countries, this is flat-out impossible in the early days.\n\nThis is why we built Philotes.\n\nPhilotes is a Discord bot that automatically matches community members for 1-on-1 chats. Leaders of online communities no longer need to take on the burden of strengthening individual bonds in their community. Instead they can just send one command: /matchOnce. As communities, especially those in crypto, become more dependent on Discord, we hope Philotes can add the magic touch.\n\nActually, we built Philotes because Donut isn't on Discord üò§",
